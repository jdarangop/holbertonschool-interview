# 0x13. Count it!


### 0. Count it!

Write a recursive function that queries the Reddit API, parses the title of all hot articles, and prints a sorted count of given keywords (case-insensitive, delimited by spaces. Javascript should count as javascript, but java should not).

Requirements:

    - Prototype: def count_words(subreddit, word_list)
    - Note: You may change the prototype, but it must be able to be called with just a subreddit supplied and a list of keywords. AKA you can add a counter or anything else, but the function must work without supplying a starting value in the main.
    - Results should be printed in descending order, by the count, not the title. Words with no matches should be skipped and not printed.
    - Results are based on the number of times a keyword appears, not titles it appears in. ‘java java java’ counts as 3 separate occurences of java.
    - To make life easier, ‘java.’ or ‘java!’ or ‘java_’ should not count as ‘java’
    - If no posts match or the subreddit is invalid, print a newline.
    - NOTE: Invalid subreddits may return a redirect to search results. Ensure that you are NOT following redirects.

Your code will NOT pass if you are using a loop and not recursively calling the function! This can be done with a loop but the point is to use a recursive function. :)
